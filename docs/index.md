# Welcome to airball

airball is a extension to REBOUND, the popular N-body integrator, for running and managing stellar flybys.  

## Features

* Logic for handling the geometry of adding, running, and removing a flyby object in a REBOUND simulation.
* Stellar environments for generating and managing randomly generated stars from different stellar environments throughout thr galaxy. 
* Initial mass functions for quickly generating samples from probability distributions. 
* Astropy.units integration to help you manage the mess of units and scales.
* Interactive examples for teaching and exploring airball's functionality.
