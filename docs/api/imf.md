"The initial mass function (IMF) is an empirical function that describes the initial distribution of masses for a population of stars during star formation" [(wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_mass_function).

`airball.IMF` is a class for implementing and managing IMFs. Given a probability distribution, `AIRBALL` will normalize and prepare the distribution for sampling in order to quickly generate random samples from it.
