# Welcome to AIRBALL

AIRBALL is a package for running and managing flybys using [REBOUND](https://github.com/hannorein/rebound). It is an extension to REBOUND, the popular N-body integrator.

*AIRBALL is currently in alpha testing. The APIs are subject to change without warning or backwards compatibility. Feedback and feature requests are very welcome.*

## Features

* Logic for handling the geometry of adding, running, and removing a flyby object in a REBOUND simulation.
* Stellar environments for generating and managing randomly generated stars from different stellar environments throughout the galaxy. 
* Initial mass functions for quickly generating samples from probability distributions. 
* Astropy.units integration to help you manage the mess of units and scales.
* Interactive examples for teaching and exploring AIRBALLâ€™s functionality. 

## Installation

AIRBALL is installable via `pip` with one simple command

```zsh
pip install airball

```

The following packages should automatically be installed along with AIRBALL:

- `rebound`
- `numpy`
- `scipy`
- `joblib`
- `astropy`
